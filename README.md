## üìñ What is This?

**URL Attack Detector** is a cybersecurity monitoring system that helps protect websites and web applications by automatically identifying malicious activities. Think of it as a security camera for your website that watches all incoming traffic and alerts you when something suspicious happens.

### üéØ What Problems Does It Solve?

- **Prevents Data Breaches**: Catches hackers trying to steal sensitive information from databases
- **Blocks Malicious Code**: Detects attempts to inject harmful scripts into your website
- **Stops Unauthorized Access**: Identifies brute-force login attempts and credential stuffing
- **Protects Server Files**: Alerts when attackers try to access restricted system files
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides instant alerts when attacks are detected

## üìù How to Use

### Step 1: Upload Your Data

The tool accepts two types of input files:

1. **PCAP Files** (`.pcap`, `.pcapng`)
   - Network packet captures from Wireshark or tcpdump
   - Contains raw network traffic data

2. **Access Logs** (`.log`, `.txt`)
   - Apache or Nginx web server logs
   - Standard combined log format

### Step 2: Analyze Traffic

1. Click the **"Upload & Analyze"** button on the dashboard
2. Select your PCAP file or access log
3. Wait for the analysis to complete (usually takes a few seconds)

### Step 3: Review Alerts

The dashboard displays all detected threats with:

- **Timestamp**: When the attack was detected
- **Source IP**: Where the attack came from
- **URL**: The targeted endpoint
- **Attack Type**: Classification of the threat
- **Confidence**: How certain the system is (0-100%)

### Step 4: Export Results

Click **"Export CSV"** to download a detailed report for:
- Security team review
- Compliance documentation
- Historical analysis
- Integration with SIEM tools

## üìä Understanding the Dashboard

### Alert Table Columns

| Column | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **ID** | Unique identifier for each alert |
| **Time** | When the suspicious activity occurred |
| **Src IP** | The IP address that initiated the request |
| **URL** | The web address that was targeted |
| **Attack** | Type of attack detected |
| **Confidence** | Reliability score (higher = more certain) |

### Confidence Levels

- **80-100%**: High confidence - likely a real attack
- **60-79%**: Medium confidence - suspicious activity
- **40-59%**: Low confidence - potentially benign

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
FLASK_ENV=development          # Set to 'production' for deployment
FLASK_APP=app.py              # Application entry point
TSHARK_PATH=/usr/bin/tshark   # Path to TShark binary
```

### Database Location

Alerts are stored in `data/alerts.db` (SQLite database). This file persists between restarts when using Docker volumes.

---

## üß™ Testing with Sample Data

A sample access log is included for testing:

```bash
# Upload the sample file through the web interface
samples/demo_access.log
```

This sample contains examples of various attack types including SQL injection, XSS, directory traversal, and SSRF attempts.

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers

### Adding New Detection Rules

1. Open `detectors.py`
2. Create a new detection function following this template:

```python
def detect_new_attack(params, raw):
    score = 0
    # Add your detection logic
    if suspicious_pattern_found:
        score += 50
    return (score >= threshold, score, 'Attack Name')
```

3. Add the function to `run_all()` function

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | Dashboard homepage |
| `/upload` | POST | Upload and analyze files |
| `/alerts` | GET | Retrieve alerts as JSON |
| `/export` | GET | Export alerts (CSV/JSON) |
